# Conclusion

The Hive experience was really nice and fun, but I believe it was mainly due to us already having setup the Hadoop cluster and only dealing with Hive & Derby's installation that only took a few hours a straight forward querying language that strongly resembles SQL with addition that were explained in detail in the official documentation.

Overall HiveQL is a goto option when dealing with data analysis over a distributed system for people that lack knowledge on map-reduce and/or are more comfortable using a querying language.
